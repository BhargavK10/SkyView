            How to get started with Star Gazing?
        </h2>
        <p>
            <b>When is best to stargaze?</b><br>
            Several factors will affect your stargazing experience. Here we share hints and tips on making your
            stargazing trip worthwhile and help you choose when is the best time to go stargazing.
            <br><br>
            <b>Moonlight</b><br>
            Natural moonlight washes out the light from most stars leaving only the brightest visible and is most
            noticeable around the time of the full-Moon. When the Moon is at its brightest fewer stars can be seen.
            Therefore, the time during full Moon is the worst time to stargaze — at this time, even dark sky sites free
            from artificial light pollution are no darker than a city centre!
            <br><br>
            The best time to go stargazing is the days before, during and soon after each new Moon, when there is no
            Moon in the sky.
            <br><br>
            During these times, there is no bright Moon to wash out the light from fainter stars. As a result, you will
            be able to see thousands of stars with just your naked eye, this compared to just a few hundred at other
            times.
            <br><br>
            It’s also the best time to see the Milky Way arching across the sky (depending on the time of year and time
            of night). You will have far better views of fainter objects such as galaxies, nebulae and star clusters
            when using a telescope during a new Moon period.

            If you want to see star-filled skies, avoiding times around the full Moon will mean you see more.
            <br><br>
            <b>Summer twilight</b><br>
            Summer months mean long days and short nights and, therefore, significantly reduce stargazing opportunities.
            Hours of morning and evening twilight are longer during the summer. The skies take longer to get dark after
            sunset and get lighter earlier before sunrise leaving only a short period to view dark skies. Around the
            summer solstice (the longest day), it hardly gets dark at all!
            <br><br>
            Twilight skies are not dark
            Skies do not get dark until late through Summer
            Observing season
            Autumn, Winter and Spring offer the best times to stargaze, and many astronomers refer to an ‘observing
            season’. From the time clocks go back in October (nights become 1-hour longer) to the time they go forward
            in March (nights become 1-hour shorter). As a result, you will find most stargazing events organised during
            this period — indeed, many non-commercial observatories stay closed during the summer months as it simply
            doesn’t get dark when the public can visit.
            <br><br>
            <b>Helping decide when is best</b><br>
            Considering all of the above factors can be tricky to decide when to go stargazing!
            You can refer to online sources that can tell you to forecast and if the sky is going to be cloudy tonight.
            You also need to make sure that it's around new moon, or the moon sets before your star gazing time.
            with these main factors in mind, you can get started with your star gazing journey! We wish you all te very best!
